This test suite is built on the Nose framework.  For more information see:

    http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/

Running the test suite:
-----------------------

Running these tests is easy.

From within the source directory you can execute all tests:
    ./run_tests_local.sh *.py

From within an installed directory:
    ./run_tests.sh *.py

Individual files or test cases can be specified:
    ./run_tests.sh cPopenTests.py
    ./run_tests.sh cPopenTests.py:TestCPopen.testEcho

Enabling slow tests:
-------------------

Some tests are too slow to run on each build. these are marked in the source
with the @slowtest decorator and are disabled by default.

To enable slow tests:
     ./run_tests_local.sh --enable-slow-tests filenme [...]

Slow tests are also enabled if NOSE_SLOW_TESTS environment variable is set.

Enabling stress tests:
---------------------

Some tests stress the resources of the system running the tests. These tests
are too slow to run on each build, and may fail on overloaded system or when
running tests in parrallel. These tests are marked in the source with the
@stresstest decorator and are disabled by default.

To enable stress tests:
     ./run_tests_local.sh --enable-stress-tests filename [...]

Stress tests are also enabled if NOSE_STRESS_TESTS environment variable is set.

Control verbose level:
---------------------

By default, tests run with verbose level 3.
To run without verbose output, set verbose level to 1.

To set verbose level:
    make check NOSE_VERBOSE=<VERBOSE LEVEL>

Functional test suite:
----------------------

The functional test suite is designed to test a running vdsm instance.  To run
the full suite of functional tests from within the installed directory:
    ./run_tests.sh functional/*.py

Test timeout
------------

If a test run is too slow, it is aborted, and a backtrace of all threads is
printed.

To use a different timeout for the tests temporary, set the TIMEOUT environment
varaible to the desired value:

    TIMEOUT=600 ./run_tests_local.sh foo_test.py
