ipv6 vdsm hook
=================================
This hook allows the user to pass IPv6 configuration for networks to VDSM.

Requirements:
* oVirt-3.5 (started supporting custom properties)

Preparation on a host:
----------------------
yum install vdsm-hook-ipv6

Preparation on the engine side:
-------------------------------
PROPERTIES='ipv6addr=.*;ipv6gateway=.*;ipv6autoconf=.*;dhcpv6=.*'
engine-config -s "UserDefinedNetworkCustomProperties=$PROPERTIES" --cver='3.5'

Don't forget to include the names of other custom network properties you may
want to use, such as 'ethtool_opts'.

Usage:
------
In the oVirt UI open the 'Setup Host Networks' dialog. Proceed to editing
a desired logical network's properties. Among them you will find 'ipv6addr'
and 'ipv6gateway', which accept custom IPv6 addresses, plus 'ipv6autoconf'
and 'dhcpv6', which accept '0', '1' or 'false', 'true'.

You may be warned that the network is in use when confirming the 'Setup Host
Networks' dialog. Make sure to stop any VMs that are using the network.
