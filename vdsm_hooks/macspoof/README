macspoof vdsm hook
=================================
These hooks allow to remove MAC and ARP spoofing filtering
from all of the VM's interfaces or for a specific vnic.

Installation:
* Use the engine-config to append the appropriate custom properties
  as such:

Custom property which removes MAC and ARP spoofing filtering
for all interfaces in a VM:

	sudo engine-config -s UserDefinedVMProperties=
	'previousProperties;macspoof=^(true|false)$' --cver=3.2

Custom property which removes MAC and ARP spoofing filtering
for a specific vnic in a VM:

  sudo engine-config -s CustomDeviceProperties=
  '{type=interface;prop={ifacemacspoof=true}}'

* Verify that the macspoof custom propertes were properly added:
	sudo engine-config -g CustomDeviceProperties

Usage:
In the VM configuration window, open the custom properites tab
and add macspoof=true for applying filtering to all VM's interfaces.

In the vnic profiles configuration window, open the custom properties
tab and add ifacemacspoof=true for applying filtering to the specific
interface.
