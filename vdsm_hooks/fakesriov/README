fake sriov vdsm hook
====================
This hook is useful for th testing SR-IOV devices in consumers of VDSM API
(like oVirt Engine for example).

The hook can be enabled by installing it first and then enabling
fake_sriov_enable in etv/vdsm/vdsm.conf.

The hook places two script which are called after the reporting of the host
devices and adds one fake devices that appears as an SR-IOV physical function
and in addition, two virtual functions which are using it.
The hook is does not require any input, and is hard coded to report pci
addresses that are not likely to interfere in what is already reported by VDSM
for real devices.
