promisc vdsm hook
=================
Hook provide ability to mirror/redirect other VMs network traffic to a single VM.

Hook is getting network (bridge) name and mode: prmisc=blue:mirror,red:redirect and
set the current running VM in promiscuous mode, ie: mirror all blue traffic to current VM

syntax:
1. promisc=blue:mirror
    # mirror monitoring the network blue (all traffic will goto the VMs interface and the network)
2. promisc=blue:redirect
    # redirect network blue traffic to VMs interface (all traffic will goto the VMs interface,
    # and the its the VM responsibility to redirect the traffic back to blues interfaces)

How to test:
from the promiscuous VM:
# tcpdump -i eth0


NOTE:
Currently the redirect is not working,
There is instructions for doing so with ebtables in after_vm_start.py script.
